    "# Rock, Paper, Scissors (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will code up the game of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors\">Rock, Paper, Scissors.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each game round consists two turns, the first by the computer and the second by a human.\n",
    "The computer continues playing rounds until the human chooses to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Each round proceeds in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The computer chooses one of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, but keeps its choice secret.\n",
    "* The computer asks for the human's input.\n",
    "* The human chooses one of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, or Quit.\n",
    "* Unless the human quits, the computer figures out the result of the game, as follows:\n",
    "     * Rock smashes Scissors, so Rock beats Scissors.\n",
    "     * Scissors can cut up paper, so Scissors beat Paper.\n",
    "     * Paper covers Rock, so Paper beats Rock.\n",
    "    * If both players chose the same, it is a draw.\n",
    "* The computer reports the result of this round.\n",
    "* If the human chooses to quit, the computer reports:\n",
    "     * the number of games played, and\n",
    "     * the number of times the human won.\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Computer's brains:\n",
    "The computer must be able to exploit some human biases.  If the human\n",
    "has played Rock most often, the computer should assume that he or she\n",
    "will play Rock in the next round, so the computer should play Paper.\n",
    "If the human has played Rock and Paper equally often, and Scissors\n",
    "less often, the computer should assume that the human is going to play\n",
    "either Rock or Paper (both equally likely) in the next round. (What\n",
    "should the computer play?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, **your program should remember how many Rock, Paper, or\n",
    "Scissors were played by the human.** Note that we don't need to\n",
    "remember the order in which the human chooses these; the total counts\n",
    "so far for each choice will be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gotchas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *User input:* How you want to receive the user's input is up\n",
    "to you, but you **must** check the user's input to make sure it is\n",
    "valid (you can assume that the user input is of the correct type).\n",
    "If it isn't, request the user for input again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write code to run the game.\n",
    "    * You should have a top-level function called \"playGame()\"\n",
    "* Use as many code cells as you want.\n",
    "* If you find yourself reusing any piece of code, write it as a separate function.\n",
    "* At the end, show a sample run of your program.\n",
    "    * In other words, call \"playGame()\" and play a game.\n",
    "* NOTE: Unlike standard Python, you don't need a \"__main__\" function here."
